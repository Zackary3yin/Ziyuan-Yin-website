      <h2>About</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          From early on, I have been drawn to one question: how do humans organize “meaning” in the brain? How is a word, a memory, or a concept stored, activated, and transformed in our nervous system—and how does that shape the way we understand the world and act in it? Over time, this curiosity became the central thread of my research: to explore how semantic memory is encoded in the human brain and to try to reverse-engineer it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that if we can understand how the brain represents meaning, we can not only shed light on the nature of consciousness and cognition but also change how humans communicate. In an age of information overload and cognitive division, many inequalities do not stem from a lack of resources alone but from the “information gap” itself—some people can quickly grasp abstract systems and cross language boundaries, while others remain stuck outside. I hope that one day there will be a more direct, cross-lingual way to transfer knowledge, so that access to information is not a barrier but a basic human right.
        </p>
        <p>
          That vision may sound distant, but I have tried to approach it through concrete work. At City University of Hong Kong, I started from clinical acoustic signals and computational modeling to understand physiological abnormality. Later I joined a startup building generative agents with “memory” and “cognition” using large language models. Now, at UCSF, I use large-scale EEG and ECoG data to study neural patterns of consciousness recovery, build interpretable temporal neural classification models, and align the semantic space of large language models with real brain activity for semantic decoding research.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>My current work focuses on two directions:</p>
        <ul class="research-list">
          <li><strong>Interpretable modeling of temporal neural signals:</strong> I build classification models that capture “semantic shifts” or cognitive turning points in complex time series, with a degree of human interpretability.</li>
          <li><strong>Aligning language-model embedding space with brain representations:</strong> I compare embedding vectors from LLMs with how the brain responds to meaning, in search of a “shared semantic space” that could support future brain–computer communication or semantic neural translation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Across all of this, I hold one conviction: the brain is not an inscrutable black box but a structured system that can be modeled and understood. I do not claim we can easily reduce “thought itself,” but I do believe we can gradually reveal the structure, limits, and ways in which thought is transformed.
